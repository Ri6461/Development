Land Rental Management System for TechnoPropertyNepalLand Rental Management System for TechnoPropertyNepal
Apr 2024 - May 2024
Developed a Python-based application to manage land rental transactions for TechnoPropertyNepal. The system reads and updates a text file containing land availability and generates detailed invoices for each transaction.

Key Features:

Land Availability Management: Read and display land availability from a text file.
Transaction Processing: Rent and return land, updating the availability status in the text file.
Invoice Generation: Create detailed invoices for each transaction, including rental duration and total amount, with unique filenames for each invoice.
Fine Calculation: Apply fines for late returns and update the records accordingly.
This project highlights my skills in Python programming, file handling, and real-world application development.Developed a Python-based application to manage land rental transactions for TechnoPropertyNepal.
